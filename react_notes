firstly, we need to create a react app..so we need to install a module called create-react-app from npm, this can be done using the following command

npm install create-react-app

Then, to create the actual application, we need to then execute

create-react-app "application_name"

In react, during styling, all the elements are names using className instead of class as in HTML because the class is a keyword that is used in ES6. So 
to prevent any confusion, class in styling is renamed as className.

JSX - JavaScript Extensions.

const element = <h1> Hello, World </h1>;

JSX is the syntactic extension to javascript. It is a shorthand notation to represent javascript function calls that evaluate to javascript objects.
React combines both UI and rendering logic.
JSX is like a JS rendition of HTML.
Underneath the hood, React is used to render the JSX.


React and ReactDOM

ReactDOM.render(What is want to render, where should I render it);



REACT COMPONENTS

A component returns a set of react elements that should appear on the screen.
These components allows us to split the UI into independent and reusable pieces.
components can also accept inputs.
The name of the component must always start with a capital letter. This will ensure that react will know that it must be mapped to a createElement.
Tags that start with a lowercase letter are treated as DOM tags.
Multiple tags can be combined in app file and then imported into index to ensure modularity.
